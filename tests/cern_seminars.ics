DESCRIPTION:Speakers: Ivan Polyakov (Syracuse University (US))\nA state wi
 th minimal quark content ccu~d~ has been observed in the full dataset coll
 ected by the LHCb experiment in Run1&2. This is the first observation of a
  new class of exotic hadrons\, containing two same-sign heavy quarks. This
  exotic state manifests itself as a narrow peak in the mass spectrum of D0
 D0π+ mesons just below the D∗+D0 mass threshold. Study of the DD and Dp
 i mass distributions suggest the interpretation of the state as an isoscal
 ar ground Tcc+ tetraquark with spin-parity numbers JP=1+. Fundamental reso
 nance parameters including the pole position\, scattering length\, effecti
 ve range and compositeness are measured to reveal important information ab
 out the nature of this new state. In addition\, an unexpected dependence o
 f the production rate as a function of track multiplicity is observed.\nht

DESCRIPTION:Speakers: Philip Sommer (University of Sheffield (GB))\nMeasur
 ements of multiboson production at the LHC probe the electroweak gauge str
 ucture of the Standard Model for contributions from anomalous couplings. P
 rocesses involving quartic gauge-boson self-interactions have only become 
 experimentally accessible with the LHC Run-2 data through the study of ele
 ctroweak diboson and triboson production. In this seminar\, recent ATLAS r
 esults on the measurement of electroweak production of a Zgamma pair in as
 sociation with two jets and the first observation of three W boson product
 ion are presented. Moreover\, precise boson and diboson differential cross
 -section measurements are interpreted in a combined  Effective Field Theo
 ry analysis\, allowing to systematically probe gauge boson self-interactio

DESCRIPTION:Speakers: Santeri Laurila (CERN)\nThe measurement of the produ
 ction of Higgs boson pairs (HH) at the LHC allows the exploration of the H
 iggs particle’s interaction with itself and is thus of utmost importance
 . In this talk we present recent results from the CMS collaboration on mea
 surements of HH production as predicted by the Standard Model and the sear
 ch for beyond-SM physics involving cascades or resonances producing HH pai
 rs. The most stringent constraints on the 4-point-coupling between WW or Z
 Z pairs with HH pairs are set\, excluding for the first time the case of n
 o such SM coupling\, with all other SM couplings in place. At the highest 
 HH invariant masses novel neural-network approaches to identification of b
 oosted Higgs bosons enhance sensitivity significantly over previous search

SUMMARY:Global and local polarization of $\\Lambda$ and anti-$\\Lambda$ hy

DESCRIPTION:Speakers: Debojit Sarkar (Wayne State University (US))\nThe ex
 treme temperatures and energy densities generated in the ultrarelativistic
  nuclear collisions produce a state of partonic matter\, the quark-gluon p
 lasma (QGP)\, which behaves almost like an ideal fluid. The created system
  may possess large orbital angular momentum leading to the global polariza
 tion of particles perpendicular to the reaction plane. Also\, local asymme
 tries in the velocity fields due to anisotropic flow can generate vorticit
 y and particle polarization along the beam direction. In parity-violating 
 weak decays of hyperons\, the momentum direction of the decay baryon is co
 rrelated with the hyperon spin. This feature can be used to measure the hy
 peron polarization and estimate the local and global vorticity of the syst
 em created in relativistic heavy-ion collisions.\n\nThis talk will present
  the recent experimental measurements of the $\\Lambda$ and $\\overline \\
 Lambda$ hyperons' local and global spin polarization in Pb-Pb collisions i
 n ALICE [1\, 2]. The first experimental evidence of a non-zero hyperon spi
 n polarization along the beam direction (local polarization) in Pb-Pb coll
 isions at the LHC will be presented. Also\, the global hyperon spin polari
 zation measurement in ALICE\, consistent with zero within experimental unc
 ertainties\, will be discussed. The comparison of the measured local polar
 ization with the hydrodynamic model calculations\, including competing con
 tributions from thermal and shear-induced vorticity\, will be shown. A com
 parison of the ALICE results with the previous STAR measurements and the c
 ollision energy dependence of the local and global hyperon spin polarizati
 on will be discussed.\n\n[1] ALICE Collaboration\, arXiv:2107.11183v1 [nuc
